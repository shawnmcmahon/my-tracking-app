First, you need to create a test project in your solution. You can do this by right-clicking on your solution in the Solution Explorer and selecting \u0022Add\u0022 -\u003E \u0022New Project\u0022. Choose the \u0022Test\u0022 category and select \u0022Unit Test Project (.NET Core)\u0022.\r\n2. Once you have created the test project, you need to add a reference to your main project. Right-click on the test project and select \u0022Add\u0022 -\u003E \u0022Reference\u0022. Choose your main project from the list and click \u0022OK\u0022.\r\n3. Now you can create a test class for your \u0060Issue\u0060 model. Right-click on the test project and select \u0022Add\u0022 -\u003E \u0022Class\u0022. Name the class something like \u0060IssueTests\u0060.\r\n4. In the \u0060IssueTests\u0060 class, you can write your unit tests. Here\u0027s an example:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060C#\r\nusing Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;\r\nusing tracking.Models;\r\n\r\nnamespace tracking.Tests\r\n{\r\n    [TestClass]\r\n    public class IssueTests\r\n    {\r\n        [TestMethod]\r\n        public void TestIssueTitleIsRequired()\r\n        {\r\n            var issue = new Issue();\r\n            var context = new ValidationContext(issue, serviceProvider: null, items: null);\r\n            var result = new List\u003CValidationResult\u003E();\r\n\r\n            var isValid = Validator.TryValidateObject(issue, context, result, true);\r\n\r\n            Assert.IsFalse(isValid);\r\n            Assert.IsTrue(result.Any(r =\u003E r.MemberNames.Contains(nameof(Issue.Title))));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nThis test checks that the \u0060Title\u0060 property of the \u0060Issue\u0060 model is required. You can add more tests for the other properties as well.\r\n5. Finally, you can run your tests by right-clicking on the test project and selecting \u0022Run Tests\u0022.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!
